# ProjectKiwi
A SQL assignment generator, runner and marker. The aim of the project is to create a lecture-end
application which allows the lecturer to upload csv files containing students' information, the assignment's query data and
the questions and have this loaded into a MYSQL database on the server end as well as autogenerate 
additional questions and data. For student's functionality, the server must autogenerate assignments fairly based on student number
and then automatically mark student's answers by comparing the expected output and actual output of the student's SQL statement.
